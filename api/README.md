# API version 4 (or API_v4)

We will show the query API_v4 for Nanocubes using the crime50k example.
In order to create such a nanocube and serve it via http, we
run the following script

```shell
#
# (0) go the the $NANOCUBE/data folder
#
# (1) create the nanocube index file 'crime50k.nanocube'
#
nanocube create <(gunzip -c crime50k.csv.gz) crime50k.map crime50k.nanocube -header
#
# (2) serve the index via http on port 51234 using the alias 'crimes'
#
nanocube serve 51234 crimes=crime50k.nanocube
```

## schema

To serve the schemas of all the Nanocube indices being served in port 51234 of
localhost we send a GET request to:
```url
http://localhost:51234/schema()
```
Note that in our case we only have one Nanocube index being served for the
crime50k example. The result of the request above is a `json` array with 
one entry: the schema of the crimes index:
```json
[
	{
		"type":"schema",

			{

			}
		],
		"measure_dimensions":[
			{
				"order":1,
				"name":"count",
				"type":"u32"
			}
		]
	}
]
```

## total

In order to get the total number of crimes indexed in `crimes` we
send the query `q(crimes)`:
```url
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes)
```
The total is 50k, since we indexed 50k records and the `value` measure
we defined in `crime50k.map` is simply a count of records.
```json
[
	{
		"type":"table",
		"numrows":1,
		"index_columns":[
		],
		"measure_columns":[
			{
				"name":"count",
				"values":[
					50000.000000
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
```

## location

The quadtree convention we use is the following:
```
0 bottom-left  quadrant (in the first split of the mercator projection contains South-America)
1 bottom-right quadrant (in the first split of the mercator projection contains Africa and South Asia)
2 top-left     quadrant (in the first split of the mercator projection contains North America)
3 top-right    quadrant (in the first split of the mercator projection contains Europe and North Asia)
```
If we want to count the number of crimes in a 256x256 quadtree-aligned grid
of the sub-cell (top-left, bottom-right, top-left) or (2,1,2), we run the query
below. Note that the cell (2,1,2) contains Chicago.
```
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes.b('location',dive(p(2,1,2),8)))
```
The result is 
```json
[
	{
		"type":"table",
		"numrows":8,
		"index_columns":[
			{
				"name":"location",
				"hint":"none",
				"values_per_row":11,
				"values":[
					2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,3,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,2,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,3,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,2,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,0,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,1,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,2,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,3
				]
			}
		],
		"measure_columns":[
			{
				"name":"count",
				"values":[
					272.000000,416.000000,12268.000000,224.000000,6838.000000,16913.000000,5460.000000,7609.000000
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
```

Note that the way the resulting grid cells are described are as paths. Since we
subdivided the cell (2,1,2) at depth 3 more 8 times (the depth of the dive), we
get that each grid cell is described by a path of 11 subdivisions. So the way
to read the result above is to split location 'values' array at every 11-th entry.
The final correspondence can also be better seen by generating the above resul in
text format.
```
http://localhost:51234/format('text');q(crimes.b('location',dive(p(2,1,2),8)))
```
which yields the following text
```
                                          location                           count
                             2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,3                      272.000000
                             2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,2                      416.000000

                             2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,2                      224.000000
                             2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,0                     6838.000000
                             2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,1                    16913.000000
                             2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,2                     5460.000000
                             2,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,3                     7609.000000
```
If instead of the path we just want the local (x,y) coordinate of the 256x256 grid,
we can use the hint `'img8'` as the last parameter of the binding `.b(...)`.
```
http://localhost:51234/format('text');q(crimes.b('location',dive(p(2,1,2),8),'img8'))
```
We now get coordinates `x` and `y` both in {0,1,...,255}
```
                                          location                           count
                                              11,7                      272.000000
                                              12,5                      416.000000
                                              13,5                    12268.000000
                                              14,5                      224.000000
                                              12,6                     6838.000000
                                              13,6                    16913.000000
                                              12,7                     5460.000000
                                              13,7                     7609.000000
```
if we want the global coord of the grid we generated we can use the hint `'img11'`:
```
http://localhost:51234/format('text');q(crimes.b('location',dive(p(2,1,2),8),'img11'))
```
We now get coordinates `x` and `y` both in {0,1,...,2047}. Note that the `y`
coordinate of the cells grow bottom-up, Chicago is above the Equator and
{1285,1286,1287} are in the upper half of 2048 or 2^11.

```
                                          location                           count
                                          523,1287                      272.000000
                                          524,1285                      416.000000
                                          525,1285                    12268.000000
                                          526,1285                      224.000000
                                          524,1286                     6838.000000
                                          525,1286                    16913.000000
                                          524,1287                     5460.000000
                                          525,1287                     7609.000000
```

A path on a quadtree can also be specified using `tile2d(z,x,y)` or `img2d(z,x,y)`.
The path `p(2,1,2)` is equivalent to `tile2d(3,2,5)` where the y coordinate grows
bottom-up, or `img2d(3,2,2)` where the y coordinate grows top down (like the standard
slippy tiles on open street maps or the conventional pixel coordinates in an image).

```
Quadtree path entry convention:

    2 | 3
    -----
    0 | 1

So path(2,1,2) is equivalent to tile2d at z=3 (path length) with x and y
having three (ie. z)  binary digits each following the convention:

    x binary digit is 0 if path entry is 0 or 2
                   is 1 if path entry is 1 or 3

    y binary digit is 0 if path entry is 0 or 1
                   is 1 if path entry is 2 or 3

So, in this case the tile2d coordinates are:

    path(2,1,2) ==> 2 1 2
                 x: 0 1 0 = 010b = 2
                 y: 1 0 1 = 101b = 5

    path(2,1,2) = tile2d(3,2,5)

In general

    tile2d(z,x,y) = img2d(z,x,(2^z)-1-y)

So

    path(2,1,2) = img2d(3,2,2)
```

We can also use the options of `tile2d_range(z,x0,y0,x1,y1)` or `img2d_range(z,x0,y0,x1,y1)`
to restrict query to a rectangular range of tiles.

## type

If we want to count the number of crimes by `type` of crime, we run the query
below and retrieve the categories either by number (category id if you will) or
by category name.
```url
# by number
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes.b('type',dive(1)))
```
yields the following json
```json
[
	{
		"type":"table",
		"numrows":31,
		"index_columns":[
			{
				"name":"type",
				"hint":"none",
				"values_per_row":1,

				]
			}
		]
	}
]
```
using the hint `'name'` we get path aliases (*ie* the category names)
```url

If we want to simply get the number of crimes of a particular type, let's say
`THEFT` we can can request it either by the theft corresponding number (a path
of length 1 described in the [schema](README.md#schema) or by name
```url
#
# by number, since by the schema query above THEFT is an alias for the number 2
# (note that there can be aliases to any path in a hierarchy, in case of
# categorical dimension which are trees of height 2, a path is simply a number).
#
#        ...
#        "23":"INTIMIDATION",
#        "2":"THEFT",
#        "4":"BURGLARY",
#        ...
#
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes.b('type',p(2)))
#
# by name, when we find a string in the TARGET parameter of a binding we assume it
# is an alias and we process as if it was the path of that alias as in the query
# above.
#
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes.b('type','THEFT'))
```
both queries result in
```json
[
	{
		"type":"table",
		"numrows":1,
		"index_columns":[
		],
		"measure_columns":[
			{
				"name":"count",
				"values":[
					11367.000000
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
```
In case we want to aggregate multiple types, we use `'pathagg'`
```url
#
# Usage pathagg: pathagg(PATH (,PATH)*)
#                pathagg(ALIAS(,ALIAS)*)
#
# by number, let's say we want THEFT and BURGLARY added up in a single value
#
#        ...
#        "23":"INTIMIDATION",
#        "2":"THEFT",
#        "4":"BURGLARY",
#        ...
#
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes.b('type',pathagg(p(2),p(4))))
#
# by name
#
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes.b('type',pathagg('THEFT','BURGLARY')))
```
both result in adding up what we saw in the drilldown query of crime `type`:
```
   THEFT                    11367.000000
BURGLARY                     2933.000000
----------------------------------------
   TOTAL                    14300.000000
```
Here is the `.json` result
```json
[
	{
		"type":"table",
		"numrows":1,
		"index_columns":[
		],
		"measure_columns":[
			{
				"name":"count",
				"values":[
					14300.000000
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
```

## time

Assuming a dimension of a nanocube is a binary tree, we can get aggregate values
for a sequence of fixed width (in the finest resolution of the tree) using the
`'intseq'` *target*.

```
#
# Usage intseq: intseq(OFFSET,WIDTH,COUNT[,STRIDE])
#
# In the example of crime50k the 'time' dimension was specified in
# the .map file as
#
# index_dimension('time',                         # dimension name
#                 input('Date'),                  # .csv column wher the input date of the record is specified
#                 time(16,                        # binary tree with 16 levels (slots 0 to 65535)
#                    '2013-12-01T00:00:00-06:00', # offset 0 corresponds to 0 hour of Dec 1, 2013 at CST (Central Standard Time)
#                    3600,                        # finest time bin corresponds to 1 hour (or 3600 secs)
#                    6*60                         # add 360 minutes or 6 hoursto to all input values since input comes as
#                                                 # if it is UTC while it is actually CST Central Standard Time
#                   ));
#
# So the time bin semantic is the following: there are 16 levels in the binary
# tree which yields a correspondence between its leaves and the numbers {0,1,...,65535}.
# By the `index_dimension` spec above, each of these numbers correspond to one hour
# aggregate of date (ie. 3600 secs). Tying back these (fine time resolution)
# numbers to the calendar, we have the following correspondence:
#
#     time interval                                             finest bin
#                                                               or leaf number
#     [2013-12-01T00:00:00-06:00,2013-12-01T00:00:00-06:00)     0
#     [2013-12-01T00:00:01-06:00,2013-12-01T01:00:00-06:00)     1
#     [2013-12-01T00:00:02-06:00,2013-12-01T02:00:00-06:00)     2
#     [2013-12-01T00:00:03-06:00,2013-12-01T03:00:00-06:00)     3
#     ...
#     [2013-12-21T00:00:03-06:00,2013-12-01T00:00:00-06:00)     480 (is 20 days later)
#     ...
#
# if we want to query 10 days of daily aggregates starting at the 20th day from
# the 0 time bin, we would like to aggregate
#
#     [480 + 00 * 24, 480 + 01 * 24)
#     [480 + 01 * 24, 480 + 02 * 24)
#     ...
#     [480 + 09 * 24, 480 + 10 * 24)
#
# we achieve that by setting
#
#     OFFSET = 480
#     WIDTH  = 24
#     COUNT  = 10
#     STRIDE = 24  (we can ommit STRIDE when it is the same as the WIDTH)
#
# so the query we wan here can be one of the two below
#
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes.b('time',intseq(480,24,10,24)))
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes.b('time',intseq(480,24,10)))
```
The result of the `'intseq'` query above is
```json
[
	{
		"type":"table",
		"numrows":10,
		"index_columns":[
			{
				"name":"time",
				"hint":"none",
				"values_per_row":1,
				"values":[
					0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
				]
			}
		],
		"measure_columns":[
			{
				"name":"count",
				"values":[
					762.000000,724.000000,660.000000,515.000000,410.000000,584.000000,713.000000,712.000000,704.000000,617.000000
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
```

While we can get to query calendar time series using `'intseq'`, there is a
more convenient way to do it using `'timeseries'`:
```
#
# Usage timeseries: timeseries(BASE_DATE,WIDTH_IN_SECONDS,COUNT[,STRIDE_IN_SECONDS])
#
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes.b('time',timeseries('2013-12-21T00:00-06',24*3600,10,24*3600)))
http://localhost:51234/q(crimes.b('time',timeseries('2013-12-21T00:00-06',24*3600,10)))
```
The result is the same as the previous `'intseq'` version:
```json
[
	{
		"type":"table",
		"numrows":10,
		"index_columns":[
			{
				"name":"time",
				"hint":"none",
				"values_per_row":1,
				"values":[
					0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
				]
			}
		],
		"measure_columns":[
			{
				"name":"count",
				"values":[
					762.000000,724.000000,660.000000,515.000000,410.000000,584.000000,713.000000,712.000000,704.000000,617.000000
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
```

# Polygons

If we want to restrict spatial queries to shapes defined by lat/lon contours,
we can use the `regions` and `poly` features enabled when we build nanocubes
using `--with-polycover`. Note that we assume the mercator projection convention
in all the geospatial interpretation here.

```url
# query a polygon defined by four lat/lon pairs (latitude first, longitude second)
http://localhost:51234/q(crime.b('location',region(18,poly('41.8595,-87.6565,41.8969,-87.6565,41.8969,-87.6013,41.8595,-87.6013'))))
```
This yelds the following `.json` result:
```json
[
	{
		"type":"table",
		"numrows":1,
		"index_columns":[
		],
		"measure_columns":[
			{
				"name":"count",
				"values":[
					3362.000000
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
```
Note that the `region` constraint expects a resolution parameter
(ie 18) and that we can define a `region` by combining `poly`s with
algebraic operators: `poly_complement`, `poly_diff`, `poly_union`, 
`poly_symdiff`, `poly_intersection`.
```python
# Region
# Region is a target based on lat/lon polygons. We define a region
# by feeding RESOLUTION and POLY to the 'region' function.
    region(RESOLUTION, POLY)
# A POLY primitive is defined by the poly function with a sequence
# of lat/lon pairs that are comma separated in a string:
    poly(LAT_LON_STRING)
# We can combine POLY objects using
    poly_complement(POLY)
    poly_diff(POLY, POLY)
    poly_union(POLY [, POLY]*)
    poly_symdiff(POLY [, POLY]*)
    poly_intersection(POLY [, POLY]*)
```
